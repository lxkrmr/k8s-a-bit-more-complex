# Practicing my Kubernetes skills

Hello,

this is a follow along of the course **Docker and Kubernetes** by Stephen Grider.
You can find the course on Udemy:

JFYI:

I am using Docker Desktop on my MacBook Air M1 to setup a local Kubernetes Cluster with some simple clicks.

Until now everything is working fine, so I can recommend to give it a try.
